## Introduction

Welcome to my SQL project, where I dive into social media data to extract valuable insights for optimizing ad campaigns. This project showcases my proficiency in SQL as I explore the dataset to uncover trends and patterns that can inform data-driven decisions in the realm of social media advertising.

## Datasets used
