## Introduction

Welcome to my SQL project, where I dive into social media data to extract valuable insights for optimizing ad campaigns. This project showcases my proficiency in SQL as I explore the dataset to uncover trends and patterns that can inform data-driven decisions in the realm of social media advertising.

## Datasets used

ig_clone_data: This SQL schema forms the backbone of our analysis. The column names are

* comments
* follows
* likes
* photo_tags

## Case Study Questions

1. Create an ER diagram or draw a schema for the given database.

2. We want to reward the user who has been around the longest. Find the 5 oldest users.

3. To understand when to run the ad campaign, figure out the day of the week most users register on?

4. To target inactive users in an email ad campaign, find the users who have never posted a photo.

5. Suppose you are running a contest to find out who got the most likes on a photo. Find out who won?

6. The investors want to know how many times does the average user post.

7. A brand wants to know which hashtag to use on a post. Find the top 5 most used hashtags.

8. To find out if there are bots, find users who have liked every single photo on the site.

9. To know who the celebrities are, find users who have never commented on a photo.

10. Now it's time to find both of them together, find the users who have never commented on any photo or have commented on every photo.
